Write a generic class named MyList, with a type parameter T. The type parameter T should be constrained to an upper bound: the Number class. The class should have as a field an ArrayList of T. Write a public method named add, which accepts a parameter of type T. When an argument is passed to the method, it is added to the ArrayList. Write two other methods, largest and smallest, which return the largest and smallest values in the ArrayList.
